# Which Python?

Once you are in Rivanna, you will want to know which version of Python you have installed as the default.

To find out, from the command line type:

```bash
which python
```

This will show you the "path" to a python interpreter. If you do not see "anaconda" in that path, run the following command:

```bash
module load anaconda
```

This will update your environment to use Anaconda's distribution of Python. 

After running the command, enter the command to see which pythion is being used to confirm that it is the one from Ancaconda.

Note that you can use `module` to run other programs on your Rivanna account. 

Type `module list` to see which programs have already been installed on your account.

Type `module spider` to see all the programs you can install.
